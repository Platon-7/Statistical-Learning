# Statistical Learning

This course is from the fourth year of my studies and was offered by the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology as a Master's course. I completed the projects with a group of Norwegian colleagues, but I never officially took the final exam due to a heavy workload, primarily caused by my job at the time as a DevOps Engineer at Orbit NTNU.

The syllabus overall included:

- Statistical learning.
- Multiple linear regression.
- Classification.
- Resampling methods.
- Model selection/regularization.
- Non-linearity.
- Tree-based methods.
- Neural networks.
